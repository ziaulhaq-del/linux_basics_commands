Soft link

ln -s m1 v1  ----soft link it will reduce the size of m1 file, m1 is original file &  v1 is a soft link, if  delete
m1 file soft link v1 won't work, it will work for file, dir as well 
likewise if dir zia  dir haq is soft link if dir zia isdeleted, haq soft link won't work

Hard link
ln m1 v1
It acts as a mirror ex m1 mirror of v1, can't be identified, hard link work only for file, no to dir

inode no each file & dir creates inode no in which we can differenciate soft & hard link

File permissions
drwx-r--r--   root root             -----> d means dir, - means file r- read ---4, w-write---2, x- execute---1

ssh shell secure to connect remote server securly we use ssh

ssh -i line.pem ec2-user@privat-ip add    -i inventry file

scp securly copy  we can copy from local to remote server

copy remote server to local  scp -i linux.pem ec2-user@public ip:/home/ec2-user/zia .
copy local to remote server   scp -i linux.pem zia.txt ec2-users@publicip:/home/ec2-user
